  abstract = { This article introduces the N-effect—the discovery that increasing the number of competitors (N) can decrease competitive motivation. Studies 1a and 1b found evidence that average test scores (e.g., SAT scores) fall as the average number of test takers at test-taking venues increases. Study 2 found that individuals trying to finish an easy quiz among the top 20\% in terms of speed finished significantly faster if they believed they were competing in a pool of 10 rather than 100 other people. Study 3 showed that the N-effect is strong among individuals high in social-comparison orientation and weak among those low in social-comparison orientation. Study 4 directly linked the N-effect to social comparison, ruling out ratio bias as an explanation of our results and finding that social comparison becomes less important as N increases. Finally, Study 5 found that the N-effect is mediated by social comparison. Limitations, future directions, and implications are discussed. }

  abstract = {Today's schools face major problems around student motivation and engagement. Gamification, or the 
incorporation of game elements into non-game settings, provides an opportunity to help schools solve these 
difficult problems. However, if gamification is to be of use to schools, we must better understand what 
gamification is, how it functions, and why it might be useful. This article addresses all three questions – what, 
how, and why bother? – while exploring both the potential benefits and pitfalls of gamification.},

  abstract = "Abstract Gamification, the application of game elements to non-game settings, continues to grow in popularity as a method to increase student engagement in the classroom. We tested students across two courses, measuring their motivation, social comparison, effort, satisfaction, learner empowerment, and academic performance at four points during a 16-week semester. One course received a gamified curriculum, featuring a leaderboard and badges, whereas the other course received the same curriculum without the gamified elements. Our results found that students in the gamified course showed less motivation, satisfaction, and empowerment over time than those in the non-gamified class. The effect of course type on students' final exam scores was mediated by students' levels of intrinsic motivation, with students in the gamified course showing less motivation and lower final exam scores than the non-gamified class. This suggests that some care should be taken when applying certain gamification mechanics to educational settings. ",

@inproceedings{whyweplaygames,
  abstract = {People play games to change or structure their internal experiences. Adults in this study, enjoy filling their heads with thoughts and emotions unrelated to work or school, others enjoy the challenge and chance to test their abilities. Games offer an efficiency and order in playing that they want in life. They value the sensations from doing new things such as dirt-bike racing or flying, that they otherwise lack the skills, resources, or social permission to do. A few like to escape the real world; others enjoy escaping its social norms. Nearly all enjoy the feeling of
challenge and complete absorption. The exciting and relaxing effects of games is very appealing and some apply its therapeutic benefits to “get perspective,” calm down after a hard
day, or build self-esteem.
%
Direct observation reveals details about player emotion. We find emotion in player’s visceral, behavioral, cognitive, and social responses to games. Players play to experience these body sensations that result from and drive their actions. Some crave the increased heart rate of excitement from a race, the skin prickling sensation from Wonder, or the tension of Frustration followed by feelings of Fiero. For others it is simply the exchange of worries and thought and
feelings for relaxation and contentment or a feeling of achievement knowing they did it right.},

    abstract = { The finding that extrinsic rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation has been highly controversial since it first appeared (Deci, 1971). A meta-analysis published in this Journal (Cameron \& Pierce, 1994) concluded that the undermining effect was minimal and largely inconsequential for educational policy. However, a more recent meta-analysis (Deci, Koestner, \& Ryan, 1999) showed that the Cameron and Pierce meta-analysis was seriously flawed and that its conclusions were incorrect. This article briefly reviews the results of the more recent meta-analysis, which showed that tangible rewards do indeed have a substantial undermining effect. The meta-analysis provided strong support for cognitive evaluation theory (Deci \& Ryan, 1980), which Cameron and Pierce had advocated abandoning. The results are briefly discussed in terms of their relevance for educational practice. }
